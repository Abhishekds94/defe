# Contributing to defe

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

Make sure you follow below guidelines before contributing.

1. Raise an issue before sending any PR (if the issue doesn't exist).
2. Make you changes to `feature` branch.
3. See if there is already an [open PR](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/defe/pulls) for the same issue.
4. All Pull Request must be on `dev` branch & NOT `master`


## Guidelines for contributing `feeders`

_Read [this](https://defe-app.herokuapp.com/feeders) to know what are feeders_

Make sure you check these things while adding feeders:

1. The Feed should be publicly available (the owner/site should mention RSS/Feed Links in their website).
2. No Feeds for personal user websites, portfolios.
(Only well-known & popular Website Feeds will be accepted :upside_down_face:)
3. Feeders should be specific to *"Technology"* or anything related to _Programmers_ or _Developers_.
4. Following things are required while contributing feeders:

- `name`: The Name of Feeder.
- `web`: The Website of the feeder/source.
- `link`: The Actual Feed (RSS/Atom) Link.

Have a look at the [already available feeders](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/defe/tree/master/core/feeders) to get more info.
